üìÅ Dotfile Syncer

Automatically monitor and sync your personal dotfiles to this GitHub repository.

This project uses a background watcher to detect changes to important configuration files and directories, automatically commit them, and push updates to GitHub.

‚∏ª

‚ú® What it Syncs

The following files and directories are monitored:
	‚Ä¢	~/.zshrc
	‚Ä¢	~/.cloginrc
	‚Ä¢	~/.gitconfig
	‚Ä¢	~/.bash_profile
	‚Ä¢	~/.ssh/

Whenever any of these change, they are automatically copied into this repository and committed.

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
	‚Ä¢	fswatch monitors files and directories for changes.
	‚Ä¢	When changes are detected:
	‚Ä¢	Files/directories are copied into the repository.
	‚Ä¢	Changes are committed with a timestamped message.
	‚Ä¢	Commits are pushed to GitHub over SSH (no password prompts).

The watcher is designed to:
	‚Ä¢	Only sync when actual content changes (not just file modification times).
	‚Ä¢	Support syncing both files and entire directories (like .ssh).

üõ† Setup Instructions
	1.	Install dependencies (if not already installed):

```bash
brew install fswatch
brew install rsync
```

	2.	Ensure SSH authentication with GitHub is configured:
		‚Ä¢	Add your SSH key to GitHub.
		‚Ä¢	Use the SSH remote URL (git@github.com:yourusername/dotfiles.git).
	
	3.	Clone this repository to your machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/dotfiles.git ~/Documents/GitHub/dotfiles
```

	4.	Start the sync script manually for testing:

```bash
bash ~/Documents/GitHub/dotfiles/dotfile_syncer.sh
```

üöÄ LaunchAgent Setup (macOS)

To run automatically at login:
	1.	Create a LaunchAgent plist at ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.dotfilewatcher.plist:

```bash
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "https://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.user.dotfilewatcher</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/bin/bash</string>
        <string>/Users/yourusername/Documents/GitHub/dotfiles/dotfile_syncer.sh</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>/tmp/dotfile_syncer.out</string>
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/tmp/dotfile_syncer.err</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

	2.	Load it:

```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.dotfilewatcher.plist
```

üìÑ Log File

Sync events and any errors are logged to:

```bash

```
